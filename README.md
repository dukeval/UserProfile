### Project List:
Using the MongoDB dataset that you generated last lesson, you will create a Node.js+Express application which can return information about a given user.
The application should have 1 endpoint, /user/:id which should return all the relevant info about that user given their ID. For information about handling dynamic routes in express see this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25623041/how-to-configure-dynamic-routes- with-express-js
